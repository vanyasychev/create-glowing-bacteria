# Create Glowing Bacteria
### About
Isn't it nice to have a luminous fish that would glow in the dark? Dreams about such pets have become a reality thanks to genetic engineering! In this project, we offer you to put on a robe of a scientist and create a luminous bacterium. You will learn the genome of these tiny creatures and some basic methods of genetic engineering.
### Learning outcomes
Learn about bacterial genome organization and genetic engineering techniques, work on data sequencing, and see how Python can be applied to bioinformatics.
### This project is a part of the following tracks
Python Core, Natural Language Processing, Django Developer
